#+TITLE: clojure-project-templates
#+STARTUP: indent

A collection clj-new templates for initial project setup. The
generated projects are intended to be customized and are relatively
minimal.

This is a new project and some of the templates may be lacking
readme's and other niceties.

* Provided templates

** integrant-system

A minimal project configured with integrant and integrant-repl.

** pathom-api

A minimal pathom api with a single resolver (includes everything in
the integrant-system template). Supports exploration via
[[https://wilkerlucio.github.io/oge/]].

* Usage

Please see [[https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new][seancorfield/clj-new]] for general instructions on
configuring clj-new as a clojure cli alias.

To use these templates, you need this repo on the classpath. I use an
entry in my =~/.clojure/deps.edn= with clj-new and this repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  :aliases
   {:new {:extra-deps {seancorfield/clj-new {:git/url "https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new.git"
                                             :sha "306f66ffc58611a6a0594b5ac251f7befe5c4777"}
                       noonian/clojure-project-templates
                       {:local/root "../projects/clojure-project-templates"}}
          :main-opts ["-m" "clj-new.create"]}}
#+END_SRC

With that configuration, generating a project looks like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  clojure -A:new template-name myname/project.appname
#+END_SRC

Please note that unlike the behavior of the built-in templates in
clj-new, these templates do not generate directories and namespaces
that include the project group name. This is not considered a best
practice, but for non-library applications and especially monorepos,
I've found it useful to be able to name things as =project.api=,
=project.frontend=, etc. without the extra clutter in the namespace.

You still need to provide a qualified symbol to clj-new to satisfy
it's validation requirements.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  clojure -A:new integrant-system myname/demo.integrant-system
#+END_SRC

Will result in a project directory called =demo.integrant-system= with
namespace names like =demo.integrant-system.system=, not
=myname.demo.integrant-system.system=.
